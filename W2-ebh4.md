<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Mention the Vendors you explored and some pros/cons for each that affected your decision</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I explored the&nbsp;Google, Amazon, and Oracle vendors and highly considered their affordability. Google<br>Service Providers seemed to be the best option because it came with free<br>credit for new users, seemed to be the most easy to understand service,<br>and had the most tutorial in case I needed help in the future.<br>I tried signing up for the Amazon service, but it seemed to cost<br>money with no free credit option (only a short free trial).&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Which vendor option did you go with and why?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Ultimately, mostly everyone in my group chose Google Service Provider themselves, so it<br>would be best to keep the continuity among us all to avoid any<br>confusion and to be able to help each other.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What issues did you face and how did you resolve them?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I was originally using Virtual Box as my vendor, but realized that it<br>is not a cloud service provider like the class requires so I had<br>to redo the process and set up Google Service Provider instead. It was<br>tedious to re-do, but it helped my get further familiar with the process<br>of setting everything up and using Github.<br></p><br></td></tr>
